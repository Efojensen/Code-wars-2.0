# Code-wars-2.0
My second assignment from the coding masters. Now in C++.

Another assignment from the coding masters. But thankfully it seems to be easier for me since it now 
came in my native language language C++ (not that complex language Python)and was relatively easier as compared to the reversing words
in the string assignment.
Here's how it went.
My task was to accept a string as input and then return the position of that letter in the english alphabet
whiles skipping punctuation marks and other symbols.
One could spot the problem with this task if he/she has seen the ASCII chart before. For example, A
is stored, in decimal as 65 whiles a is stored as 97. After several hours of thinking I came up with the 
solution that if we subtracted one less the index of the first letters, that is A and a, I could return the 
position of the letters the way we humans understood them.
There it is guys! The problem has been solved. Now I've gotta go and prepare for end-of-sem exams.
("Yay...")
I really hate exams but ah well... It's something we all have to go through so I can't complain.
There are stronger people out there and I can't be here slacking off.
Go beyond...Plus Ultra!
